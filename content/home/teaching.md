# Task-Space Inverse Dynamics (TSID)
#### [Memmo Winter School](https://memmows.sciencesconf.org),  January 28-31 2019, IDIAP (Martigny, Switzerland)
I have given a 3-hour class about TSID, covering both theory and implementation. Here you can find videos and slides:

- TSID Theory ([slides](https://andreadelprete.github.io/teaching/tsid/1_tsid_theory.pdf),  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSPSLbgrtQg&t=1834s))
- TSID Implementation ([slides](https://andreadelprete.github.io/teaching/tsid/2_tsid_implementation.pdf), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9g3L3YMhds))

I have also given a class on [robust TSID](https://andreadelprete.github.io/publication/2016_tro_robust_inv_dyn/):
