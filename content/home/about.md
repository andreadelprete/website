# About Me

My name is Andrea Del Prete. I am a robotics researcher in the [Gepetto team](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php) (LAAS-CNRS, Toulouse), where I work (mainly) with the humanoid robot HRP-2. My research focuses on the use of optimization algorithms for control, planning and estimation of legged robots. In this website you can find all my publications with links to open-access PDF files, videos and code. Each publication has a dedicated page where visitors can leave comments.

Before coming to LAAS in 2014 I have spent four years (3 of PhD + 1 of post-doc) at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genova, Italy), where I have worked with [Lorenzo Natale](http://lornat75.github.io/) and [Francesco Nori](http://iron76.github.io/) on the [iCub](http://www.icub.org/) humanoid robot.

In 2013 I started a fruitful collaboration with [Michele Focchi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele_Focchi), an IIT researcher working with the [Hydraulic Quadruped HyQ](http://new.semini.ch/research/hyq-robot/).
