# Biography

Andrea Del Prete was born in Cesena (Italy) in 1984. Since 2014 he has been a PostDoc at LAAS-CNRS in Toulouse, working on model-based control with HRP-2. 

His research focuses on the use of optimization algorithms for control, planning and estimation of legged robots. He is interested in convex optimization, model predictive control, robust optimization, chance-constrained programming, joint torque control, capturability, multi-body dynamics, redundant and underactuated robots, reinforcement learning.
