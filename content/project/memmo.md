# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The project Memmo aims to solve the problem of generating complex movements for arbitrary robots with arms and legs interacting in a dynamic environment by 1) relying on massive off-line caching of pre-computed optimal motions that are 2) recovered and adapted online to new situations with real-time tractable model predictive control and where 3) all available sensor modalities are exploited for feedback control going beyond the mere state of the robot for more robust behaviors."
