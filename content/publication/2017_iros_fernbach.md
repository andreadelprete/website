abstract = "We   present   a   novel   method   for   synthesizing collision-free, dynamic locomotion behaviors for legged robots, including jumping, going down a very steep slope, or recovering from a push using the arms of the robot. The approach is automatic and generic: non-gaited motions, comprising arbitrary contact  postures  can  be  generated  along  any  environment. At  the  core  of  our  framework  is  a  new  steering  method that  generates  trajectories  connecting  two  states  of  the  robot. These  trajectories  account  for  the  state-dependent,  centroidal dynamic  constraints  inherent  to  legged  robots.  The  method, of  low  dimension,  formulated  as  a  Linear  Program,  is  really efficient  to  compute,  and  can  find  an  application  in  various problems  related  to  legged  locomotion. By   incorporating   this   steering   method   into   an   existing sampling-based  contact  planner,  we  propose  the  first  kinodynamic  contact  planner  for  legged  robots."
