abstract = "Linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) has been successfully  used  for  generating  feasible  walking  motions  for humanoid   robots.   However,   the   effect   of   uncertainties   on constraints  satisfaction  has  only  been  studied  using  RobustMPC  (RMPC)  approaches,  which  account  for  the  worst-case realization  of  bounded  disturbances  at  each  time  instant.  In this letter, we propose for the first time to use linear stochasticMPC (SMPC) to account for uncertainties in bipedal walking.We  show  that  SMPC  offers  more  flexibility  to  the  user  (or  a high  level  decision  maker)  by  tolerating  small  (user-defined)probabilities  of  constraint  violation.  Therefore,  SMPC  can  be tuned  to  achieve  a  constraint  satisfaction  probability  that  is arbitrarily close to 100%, but without sacrificing performance as  much  as  tube-based  RMPC.  We  compare  SMPC  againstRMPC  in  terms  of  robustness  (constraint  satisfaction)  and performance  (optimality).  Our  results  highlight  the  benefits  ofSMPC and its interest for the robotics community as a powerful mathematical  tool  for  dealing  with  uncertainties."
