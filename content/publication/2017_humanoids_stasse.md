abstract = "The upcoming generation of humanoid robots will have  to  be  equipped  with  state-of-the-art  technical  features along with high industrial quality, but they should also offer the prospect of effective physical human interaction. In this paper we introduce a new humanoid robot capable of interacting with a human environment and targeting a whole range of industrial applications. This  robot  is  able  to  handle  weights  of  6  Kg  with  an  out-stretched arm, and has powerful motors to carry out movements unavailable  in  previous  generations  of  humanoid  robots.  Its kinematics has been specially designed for screwing and drilling motions.  In  order  to  make  interaction  possible  with  human operators, this robot is equipped with torque sensors to measure joint effort and high resolution encoders to measure both motor and  joint  positions. The  humanoid  robotics  field  has  reached  a  stage  where robustness  and  repeatability  is  the  next  watershed.  We  believe that, this robot has the potential to become a powerful tool for the  research  community  to  successfully  navigate  this  turning point,  as  the  humanoid  robot  HRP-2  was  in  its  own  time."
