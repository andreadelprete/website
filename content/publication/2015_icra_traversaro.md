abstract = "Classically robot force control passes through joint torques measurement or estimation. Within this context, classical torque sensing technologies rely on current sensing on motor windings and on torsion sensing on motor shaft. An alternative approach was recently proposed in [1] and combines whole-body distributed 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors, gyroscopes, accelerometers and tactile sensors (i.e. artificial skin). A further advantage of this method is that it simultaneously estimates (internal) joint torques and (external) contact forces with no need of joint redesign. As a drawback, the method relies on a model of the robot dynamics, as it consists on reordering the classical recursive Newton-Euler algorithm (RNEA). In this paper we consider the problem of the parametric identification of the robot dynamic model from embedded F/T sensors. We extend recent results on parametric identification [2] by considering an arbitrary reordering of the classical RNEA. The theoretical framework is validated on the iCub humanoid, which is equipped with both 6-axis F/T sensors and joint torque sensors.We estimated the system inertial parameters using only one F/T sensor. We used the obtained parameters to estimate the joint torques (as proposed in [1]) and compared the results with direct joint torque measurements, used in this context only as a ground truth."
